<span class="be-a-member-text">City Talk will help Thais grow in their understanding of other cultures and worldviews.  With ASEAN opening the trade borders in 2016, Thais not only need to excel in the chosen trade language (English), they also need to understand the cultures and worldviews of people around them.  One important worldview Thais will increasingly interact with is Christianity.  As trade and commerce increase throughout the ASEAN region, Thais will meet and develop relationships with government leaders, business managers, sales executives and students who are Christians.  For these relationships to be mutually beneficial and successful, both sides must understand each other's culture and worldview.  With that in mind, a recent sudy revealed that the majority of Thais (89%) do not understand the basics of the Christian worldview. Therefore, in an effort to help Tahis increase their knowledge of other worldviews, this course offers a 15-minute English lesson about the Christian worldview at the end of each class.  Students will see that the Chrstian worldview is not only interesting, but it is also simple to understand.</span>
