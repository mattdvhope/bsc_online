  <p class="paragraph">
    The City English Project makes learning English convenient, affordable and fun! Our specially designed learning model and network connects Thais with native-English speakers through on-site English classes, online face-to-face conversation partnerships with native English speakers, as well as through our integrated online learning community. We focus on what you need the most - conversational English skills! Our classes and partnerships are a fun and engaging way to help students of all levels improve thier ability to speak English. Even more, our model is unique in that we integrate aspects of culture and worldview study into our teaching model. We desire not only to help you speak better English but also to equip you to build successful, cross-cultural business and personal relationships within the ASEAN community and beyond!
