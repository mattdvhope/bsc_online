<h4>The ability to speak English is an important skill that can open many doors.  Why not come and learn English with native English speakers at the City English Project Center on Monday through Thursday from 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm for the month of June?  Here is what you need to know:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Each evening Monday through Thursday, CEP staff will teach a 1-hour class that will focus on popular conversation topics and important language skills.</li>
  <li>You will learn vocabulary, pronunciation, as well as new expressions.</li>
  <li>You will meet new American (and maybe even some Thai) friends.</li>
  <li>Instead of going home and watching T.V. or playing video games, you will be spending your evenings improving yourself.</li>
  <li>It is FREE!  Now, just because it is free doesnâ€™t mean the classes are not any good. In fact, the opposite is true!</li>
</ol>
<h4>So, what do you have to lose?  Bring your friend and come and give learning English with us a try.</h4>
