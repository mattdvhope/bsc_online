            <h4>Step 1: Register your church, business or organization</h4>
            <p>In order to ensure that our CEP students receive the highest quality English education experience possible, we ask that you first register your church, business or organization.</p>

            <h4>Step 2: Invite Volunteers!</h4>
            <p>Invite folks from your church, organization, etc to this web page to Register in "Volunteer" status.  They must receive a PIN from you to Register in "Volunteer" status.  Otherwise, they can only Register in "Student" status.</p>

            <h4>Step 3: Multiply volunteers!</h4>
            <p>Encourage the people from your church, organization, etc to also invite other people whom they know to consider volunteering for City English Project.  You can then give them a PIN as well for them to Register in 'Volunteer status.'</p>
