There are two ways for volunteers to get involved with City English Project. Volunteers can serve locally in the Bangkok area through teaching our "You Can Speak!" English culture and worldview class. If volunteers are interested in serving, but cannot make the trip to Bangkok, they can become an online conversation partner. If you are interested in any of the two volunteer options, please look at the details below to find steps on how to become a City English Project (CEP) volunteer.
