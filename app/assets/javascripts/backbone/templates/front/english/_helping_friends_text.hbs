<h3><span class="stepTitle">Friends Helping Friends</span></h3><h3><span class="steps">One question we get asked is, "How are your English classes and online partnerships so affordable?"  It is true that studying English (especially with native English speakers) can be VERY expensive in Thailand! We are able to offer our classes and online partnerships way below our competitorâ€™s rates for two reasons. First, our project is non-profit. We exist to serve Thai people, not make money. All income is used to expand and improve our services to you. Second, we are able to offer the price we do because our TESOL certified English teachers and conversation partners are all volunteers! They are Christians who volunteer their time to serve and help the people of Thailand. They come from a long history of Christian volunteers who have loved and served Thai people. Click here for a brief outline of how international Christian volunteers have impacted Thailand for many generations. Because they are Christian volunteers you can expect them to have high commitments to excellence in how they serve you. You can also expect them to genuinely care about helping you progress.</span></h3>
