The City English Project makes learning English convenient, affordable and fun! We connect Thais with native English speakers through on-site English classes and online conversation partnerships in our online learning community. We focus on conversational English skills! We make learning English fun no matter what your level! We also teach you about other cultures and world views.  This will help prepare you to have successful business and personal relationships in the ASEAN community and beyond! Click here to learn more about us.
