That is one of the main reasons we started the project.  One question we often get asked is, "How are your English classes and online partnerships so affordable?" We are able to make our classes and partnerships affordable for two reasons.  First, we are a non-profit project. We exist to serve Thai people, not make money. All income is used to support and expand our services to you. Second, our TESOL certified English teachers and conversation partners are all volunteers.
