<h3><span class="stepTitle">A Holistic Model</span></h3><h3><span class="steps">The heart of what we do is conversational English. However, everyone knows that learning English is not enough to help you excel in cross-cultural business and personal relationships. That's why our model integrates basic elements of culture and worldview into our classes. For example, in our introductory City Talk class you will learn basic cultural tips like how to properly shake hands and introduce yourself in a culturally appropriate way. You will also learn an easy to remember outline that gives you a basic understanding of the Christian worldview - a worldview that impacts, at least in some ways, over two billion people around the world. Our online network will also offer additional classes on culture and global worldviews.</span></h3>
