(Since our domain name is very new, many email providers (like "Hotmail" and others) will automatically put emails from "info@cityenglishproject" into your "Junk" mailbox.  If you do not see our follow-up email to you in your regular inbox, please look in your "Junk" mailbox. If you see it there, please move it to your regular "Inbox."  If you do that, then future emails from "info@cityenglishproject.com" will automatically go to your inbox.  Also, you will help improve CEP's relationship with "Hotmail," etc and help other people automatically receive emails in their inboxes in the future!  If you do not receive an email at all, please write to use at info@cityenglishproject.com for information about your classes.  Thank you very much!)
